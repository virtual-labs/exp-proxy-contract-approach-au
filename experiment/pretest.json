      "question": "What is the purpose of a Proxy contract in the context of smart contracts?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To execute complex computations in the blockchain.",
        "b": "To delegate control and functionalities to another contract.",
        "c": "To store large amounts of data in the blockchain.",
        "d": "To secure private keys in a smart contract."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is not the primary purpose of a Proxy contract.",
        "b": "Correct! A Proxy contract delegates control and functionalities to another contract.",
        "c": "Proxy contracts are not primarily used for storing large amounts of data.",
        "d": "Securing private keys is not a typical role of Proxy contracts."

      "question": "What is the Proxy contract storage layer responsible for?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Executing computations is typically handled by the logic layer, not the storage layer.",
        "b": "Storing data is not the primary responsibility of the storage layer in a Proxy contract.",
        "c": "Correct! The Proxy contract storage layer is responsible for managing the state and storage.",
