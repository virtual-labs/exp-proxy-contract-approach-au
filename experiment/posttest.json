      "question": "In a Proxy contract approach, what is the primary function of the Proxy contract logic layer?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Managing the state and storage of the Proxy contract.",
        "b": "Executing complex computations and functionalities.",
        "c": "Interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.",
        "d": "Storing and retrieving data from the blockchain."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Managing state and storage is typically the responsibility of the storage layer.",
        "b": "Correct! The Proxy contract logic layer is primarily responsible for executing complex computations and functionalities.",
        "c": "Interacting with the Ethereum blockchain is a broader responsibility involving both layers.",
        "d": "Storing and retrieving data is more associated with the storage layer."

      "question": "How does a Proxy contract storage layer contribute to the overall functionality?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Executing complex computations.",
        "b": "Interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.",
        "c": "Managing the state and storage of the Proxy contract.",
        "d": "Handling external calls from other contracts."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Executing computations is typically handled by the logic layer, not the storage layer.",
        "b": "Interacting with the Ethereum blockchain is a broader responsibility involving both layers.",
        "c": "Correct! The Proxy contract storage layer is responsible for managing the state and storage.",
        "d": "Handling external calls is generally associated with the logic layer, not the storage layer."

    {
      "question": "Why might using a Proxy contract be beneficial in smart contract development?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase the gas limit for transactions.",
        "b": "To delegate control and upgradeability.",
        "c": "To encrypt sensitive data in the blockchain.",
        "d": "To reduce the overall complexity of the contract code."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Increasing the gas limit is not a primary reason for using a Proxy contract.",
        "b": "Correct! Using a Proxy contract allows for better control delegation and upgradeability.",
        "c": "Encrypting data is not a typical role of Proxy contracts.",
        "d": "Reducing overall complexity is not a primary benefit of using a Proxy contract."
